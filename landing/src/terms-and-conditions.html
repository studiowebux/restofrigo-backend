                Welcome to Rest O Frigo! By downloading or using our app, you
                agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions. If you
                do not agree with any part of these terms, please do not use our
                app.
            </p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms and Conditions govern your use of Rest O Frigo
                ("restofrigo", "rest-o-frigo"), a mobile application developed
                by Studio Webux ("We", "Us", or "Our"). By using our App, you
                acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be
                bound by these terms.
            </p>

            <h2>License Agreement</h2>
            <p>
                You are granted a non-exclusive, revocable license to access and
                use the app on your devices solely for personal, non-commercial
                purposes. This does not convey any ownership rights over the app
                or its contents. You may not distribute, reproduce, modify, or
                create derivative works based on our app.
            </p>

            <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use the app in accordance with all applicable laws and
                    regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoid any actions that might harm the app’s operation,
                    integrity, or security.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not attempt to decompile, reverse engineer, or
                    disassemble the app, except as expressly allowed by law for

                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
            <p>
                The Restofrigo app, including its user interface, source code,
                and branding elements, is owned by Studio Webux. However, since
                the app relies on a self-hosted backend, all generated content,
                and configurations within the backend are fully owned and
                controlled by the user. You are free to customize, extend, or
                self-host the backend as needed. Redistribution or resale of the
                app itself requires prior written permission from Studio Webux.
            </p>

            <h2>Modifications to Terms</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Changes
                will be communicated via email or through in-app notifications.
                Continued use of the app following any modifications signifies
                your acceptance of the new terms.
            </p>

            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
                To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we shall not
                be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special,
                punitive, consequential, or exemplary damages arising from or
                relating to these Terms, your use of the app, or access thereto.
                This includes, without limitation, loss of profits, goodwill,
                data, use, or other intangible losses.
            </p>

            <h2>Termination</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to terminate your access to the app at any
                time for any reason, with or without notice, including but not
                limited to a breach of these Terms by you. Upon termination, all
                rights granted herein will immediately cease.
            </p>

            <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>
                Any disputes arising out of or relating to this agreement shall
                be resolved in accordance with applicable law and the
                jurisdiction specified under the "Governing Law" section below.
                We encourage users to first attempt resolution through direct
                communication before pursuing legal action.
